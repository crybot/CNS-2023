README

usage: All required code is within the notebook `LAB3_2.ipynb`, along with some documentation.

The required plots are included in the files `test.png` and `training.png` for both training and testing.

The weight matrices for the ESN are saved in binary format in the `dump.npz` file. You can load the weights by using the last cell of the notebook, which also performs model evaluation after having loaded the weights into the appropriate class.
